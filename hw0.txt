# Description of your program (part 7)
Have a piece of paper and a pen out. Start at the first character of the document. Check to see if the character is a space. If it is, continue checking characters until you reach a character that's a letter. Then check the character after that. If it is a space, put a tally on your paper. If it isn't, keep checking characters until you reach another space. Every time you reach a space, add another tally to your paper. Continue until you reach the end of the document. The number of tallies on your paper should be the number of words in the document.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
It was somewhat easy. I was definitely thinking in terms of code, which made it hard to translate it into english. It was also difficult because I wasn't sure about the exact constraints of the document, like if it started with a letter for sure, or it was possible for it to start with an indent or something. Because of this, I wasn't sure what I could assume. I tried to keep it as simple as possible otherwise. I think it can be easier to think of instructions in english because that's what I'm used to, but in a class like this, I can't help but think of it in terms of code.
